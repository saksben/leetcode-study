# Trees Pattern
Trees Pattern: use when you need to traverse, manipulate, or search through a tree data structure efficiently.

The Trees pattern involves operations on a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges. This pattern is essential for problems requiring hierarchical relationships between elements, such as binary trees, n-ary trees, or balanced trees like AVL or Red-Black trees. It optimizes operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal compared to linear data structures.

# Explanation of the Pattern
A Tree consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and references (or links) to child nodes. Operations involve traversing nodes from the root to leaf nodes or vice versa, manipulating nodes to maintain balance, and searching for specific elements or patterns within the tree structure.

# Key Concepts
* Node: Basic unit containing data and references to child nodes.
* Root, Parent, and Child Nodes: Fundamental relationships in tree structures.
* Traversal Algorithms: Methods for visiting nodes (e.g., depth-first, breadth-first).
* Balancing: Techniques to keep the tree structure balanced (e.g., rotations in AVL trees).
* Binary vs. N-ary Trees: Distinctions based on the number of child nodes per parent node.

# When to Use This Pattern
* Representing hierarchical data relationships (e.g., organizational charts, file systems).
* Implementing efficient searching, insertion, or deletion operations.
* Problems involving pathfinding, subtree operations, or binary search tree properties.

# Common Use Cases and Approaches
1. Binary Tree Traversal (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder)
* Use recursive or iterative methods to visit nodes in a specific order.
* Adjust traversal strategies based on the desired sequence.
Time Complexity: O(n), Space Complexity: O(h) where h is the height of the tree.

2. Level Order Traversal (Breadth-First Search)
* Use a queue to visit nodes level by level, starting from the root.
* Adjust queue operations to process child nodes in a structured manner.
Time Complexity: O(n), Space Complexity: O(n) (worst case when the tree is completely unbalanced).

3. Binary Search Tree (BST) Operations (Insertion, Deletion, Search)
* Use recursive or iterative methods to maintain the BST properties.
* Adjust pointers to insert, delete, or search for nodes efficiently.
Time Complexity: O(log n) on average for balanced trees, O(n) worst-case for unbalanced trees; Space Complexity: O(h).

4. Serialize and Deserialize a Binary Tree
* Convert a binary tree into a string or array format and vice versa.
* Adjust serialization and deserialization methods to preserve tree structure.
Time Complexity: O(n), Space Complexity: O(n) for serialization and O(n) for deserialization.
