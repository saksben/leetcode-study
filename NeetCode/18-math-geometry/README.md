# Math Geometry Pattern
Math Geometry Pattern: use when you need to solve problems involving geometric shapes, distances, angles, or spatial relationships.

The Math Geometry pattern involves applying mathematical concepts and formulas to solve problems related to geometric figures in two-dimensional or three-dimensional space. This pattern is essential for problems where calculations of distances, areas, intersections, or orientations of geometric entities are required.

# Explanation of the Pattern
Math Geometry utilizes principles from geometry, trigonometry, and algebra to analyze and solve problems involving shapes and spatial relationships. Techniques include computing distances between points, determining intersections of lines or shapes, calculating areas or volumes, and analyzing angles or orientations of geometric entities. Efficient algorithms and formulas are used to optimize these calculations.

# Key Concepts
* Geometric Figures: Representations of shapes like points, lines, circles, polygons, and three-dimensional objects.
* Distance and Angle Calculations: Using formulas to compute distances between points, angles between vectors, or intersections of geometric entities.
* Transformation and Rotation: Techniques to translate or rotate shapes in space.
* Computational Geometry Algorithms: Efficient algorithms for geometric problems (e.g., Graham's scan for convex hull, sweep line algorithms).
* Spatial Relationships: Determining relationships like containment, overlap, or adjacency between geometric entities.

# When to Use This Pattern
* Problems involving spatial data analysis, graphics rendering, or simulation of physical phenomena.
* Optimization problems where geometric constraints play a crucial role.
* Applications requiring precise measurements, such as engineering, computer graphics, or geographical analysis.
