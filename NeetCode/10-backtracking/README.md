# Backtracking Pattern
Backtracking Pattern: use when you need to explore all potential solutions to a problem and choose the best one.

The Backtracking pattern involves systematically searching through all possible configurations to find the solution. This pattern is useful for problems where the solution space is relatively small, and it's feasible to try all possibilities efficiently. It optimizes exploration by pruning paths that cannot lead to a solution early in the search.

# Explanation of the Pattern
Backtracking involves recursively trying different choices, moving forward to explore potential solutions, and backtracking to undo those choices if they don't lead to a solution. It's particularly useful for problems that can be formulated as finding paths in a graph, generating permutations, or solving puzzles.

# Key Concepts
* Recursive Exploration: Systematically exploring potential solutions through recursive calls.
* Decision Tree: Representing choices and their consequences as a tree structure.
* Pruning: Avoiding unnecessary exploration by terminating paths early.
* Path Construction: Building and validating potential solutions step-by-step.

# When to Use This Pattern
* Generating all permutations or combinations of a set.
* Solving puzzles like Sudoku, N-Queens, or Knight's Tour.
* Finding paths in a maze or graph that satisfy certain conditions.
* Problems requiring exhaustive search through a solution space.

# Common Use Cases and Approaches
1. N-Queens Problem
* Place queens on an NxN chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.
* Use backtracking to explore and validate potential placements.
Time Complexity: O(n!), Space Complexity: O(n).

2. Sudoku Solver
* Fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.
* Use backtracking to explore and validate possible digit placements.
Time Complexity: O(9^(nn)), Space Complexity: O(nn).

3. Subset Sum Problem
* Find if there is a subset of a given set of integers that sums to a given target.
* Use backtracking to explore different subsets and check their sums.
Time Complexity: O(2^n), Space Complexity: O(n).

4. Pathfinding in a Maze
* Find a path from the start to the goal in a maze represented as a grid.
* Use backtracking to explore and validate possible paths through the maze.
Time Complexity: O(4^(nm)), Space Complexity: O(nm).
