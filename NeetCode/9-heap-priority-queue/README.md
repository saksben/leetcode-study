# Heap and Priority Queue Pattern
Heap and Priority Queue Pattern: use when you need to efficiently retrieve the maximum or minimum element and maintain order in a collection of elements.

The Heap and Priority Queue pattern involves using a specialized data structure to maintain the highest (or lowest) priority elements at the root, allowing efficient access and manipulation operations. This pattern is particularly useful for problems requiring dynamic ordering and quick retrieval of extremal values.

# Explanation of the Pattern
A Heap is a binary tree-based data structure where each node satisfies the heap property. Priority Queues are commonly implemented using Heaps to ensure efficient insertion, deletion, and retrieval of elements based on priority. Operations maintain the heap property through heapify operations, ensuring the root node always holds the highest (or lowest) priority element.

# Key Concepts
* Heap Property: Ensures that each parent node is higher (or lower) priority than its children.
* Max-Heap and Min-Heap: Structures where the root node holds the maximum or minimum element, respectively.
* Priority Queue Operations: Insertion, extraction of extremal elements, and maintaining order.
* Heapify Operations: Adjusts heap structure after insertion or deletion to restore the heap property efficiently.

# When to Use This Pattern
* Implementing scheduling algorithms (e.g., task scheduling based on priority).
* Sorting elements where partial sorting is sufficient (e.g., finding k largest/smallest elements).
* Problems requiring efficient access to extremal elements.

# Common Use Cases and Approaches
1. Finding K Largest Elements
* Use a Min-Heap to maintain the k largest elements encountered so far.
* Adjust heap structure to accommodate new elements based on comparisons.
Time Complexity: O(n log k), Space Complexity: O(k).

2. Priority Task Scheduling
* Use a Max-Heap to prioritize tasks based on their urgency or importance.
* Adjust heap structure to insert new tasks and extract tasks according to priority.
Time Complexity: O(log n) for insertion and extraction operations, Space Complexity: O(n).

3. Merge K Sorted Lists
* Use a Min-Heap to merge k sorted lists into one sorted list.
* Adjust heap structure to continuously extract and insert elements based on comparisons.
Time Complexity: O(n log k) where n is the total number of elements, Space Complexity: O(k).

4. Top K Frequent Elements
* Use a Min-Heap to find the k most frequent elements in an array.
* Adjust heap structure to maintain the k most frequent elements based on frequency counts.
Time Complexity: O(n log k), Space Complexity: O(n).
