# Tries Pattern
Tries Pattern: use when you need to efficiently store and retrieve strings or keys with common prefixes.

The Tries pattern, also known as a prefix tree, is used to represent a set of strings or associative arrays where all strings share a common prefix. This pattern is particularly useful for problems involving auto-completion, spell checking, and dictionary implementations, optimizing prefix-based searches and insertions.

# Explanation of the Pattern
A Trie is a tree-like data structure where each node represents a character or a key in a string. Nodes may have multiple children nodes, each corresponding to a different character. By traversing from the root node to the desired node, you can efficiently insert, search, or delete strings.

# Key Concepts
* Node: Basic unit containing character data and references to child nodes.
* Root Node: Starting point of the Trie structure.
* Prefix Matching: Finding all strings with a common prefix efficiently.
* Insertion and Search: Operations that navigate through nodes based on character sequences.
* Memory Efficiency: Saves space compared to hash tables when storing large sets of strings with common prefixes.

# When to Use This Pattern
* Storing and retrieving strings with shared prefixes (e.g., dictionary applications).
* Implementing auto-complete functionality in search engines or text editors.
* Problems requiring efficient prefix-based operations.

# Common Use Cases and Approaches
1. Insertion and Search in a Trie
* Traverse through nodes based on character sequences.
* Adjust pointers to insert new strings or search for existing ones efficiently.
Time Complexity: O(m), where m is the length of the string; Space Complexity: O(m).

2. Auto-complete Feature
* Use Trie structure to store dictionary words or search terms.
* Adjust traversal to find all strings with a common prefix for auto-completion suggestions.
Time Complexity: O(p + q), where p is the length of the prefix being completed, and q is the number of matching strings.

3. Count Prefixes
* Maintain a count of how many times each prefix appears in a collection of strings.
* Adjust Trie nodes to keep track of prefix occurrences.
Time Complexity: O(m), Space Complexity: O(m) for insertion and O(1) for prefix count retrieval.

4. Longest Prefix Matching
* Find the longest prefix of a given string that matches any string stored in a Trie.
* Adjust traversal to identify the longest matching prefix efficiently.
Time Complexity: O(m), where m is the length of the longest matching prefix.
