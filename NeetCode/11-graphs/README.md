# Graphs Pattern
Graphs Pattern: use when you need to represent and traverse relationships between objects in a complex network.

The Graphs pattern involves modeling connections (edges) between entities (vertices or nodes) in a network. This pattern is essential for problems requiring pathfinding, traversal, and analysis of relationships between elements. It optimizes operations like traversal and shortest path calculations compared to other data structures.

# Explanation of the Pattern
A Graph consists of a set of vertices and edges connecting pairs of vertices. Depending on the problem, graphs can be directed (edges have a direction) or undirected (edges have no direction). Operations involve traversing nodes, discovering connected components, finding paths, and analyzing properties like cycles or connectivity.

# Key Concepts
* Vertices and Edges: Nodes and connections representing objects and relationships.
* Directed and Undirected Graphs: Differences in edge directionality affecting traversal.
* Traversal Algorithms: Methods for visiting nodes (e.g., depth-first search, breadth-first search).
* Shortest Path Algorithms: Techniques to find the shortest path between nodes (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm, Bellman-Ford algorithm).
* Cycle Detection: Identifying cycles within graphs to prevent infinite loops.

# When to Use This Pattern
* Modeling relationships in social networks, maps, or computer networks.
* Pathfinding in GPS navigation systems or network routing.
* Analyzing dependencies between tasks or processes in scheduling problems.
* Problems involving connectivity, flow, or reachability in networks.

# Common Use Cases and Approaches
1. Depth-First Search (DFS)
* Traverse graph nodes depth-wise, recursively or iteratively.
* Adjust traversal strategies based on problem requirements (e.g., detecting cycles).
Time Complexity: O(V + E), Space Complexity: O(V) where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.

2. Breadth-First Search (BFS)
* Traverse graph nodes level by level, using a queue.
* Adjust queue operations to explore neighbors breadth-wise.
Time Complexity: O(V + E), Space Complexity: O(V).

3. Shortest Path in Weighted Graphs (Dijkstra's Algorithm)
* Find the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes.
* Adjust priority queue operations based on edge weights.
Time Complexity: O((V + E) log V) using a priority queue, Space Complexity: O(V).

4. Minimum Spanning Tree (Prim's Algorithm)
* Find the minimum weight spanning tree for a connected, weighted graph.
* Adjust heap operations to select and add edges with minimum weight.
Time Complexity: O(E log V), Space Complexity: O(V + E).
